# Big Mapper
This is a utility for pico8, designed for editing map data. It will eventually be expanded upon, allowing you to edit and save to the pico8 extended memory.

## Setup
This cannot be run standalone - it must be run from the pico8 desktop client.

1. Run this file from commandline, with the following arguments:
```
pico8 -displays_x 2 -displays_y 2 mapper.p8
```
2. Code editing only takes place in the upper-left quadrant, which is why i edit the code externally in mapper.lua.
3. Usage instructions:
```
Pan map around: ESDF
Select a different sprite to place: Arrow Keys
Switch between paint (point) and fill modes: B
Save current map to cart ROM: 5
Export current map to another cart (you will need to edit line 187): 4
Paint or fill: Left mouse click
Dropper: RIght mouse Click
Undo: Z -- may be buggy!
```

## Running in multi-display
If you are mostly interested in multi-display, this is my current understanding of it:
1. You must run pico8 client from commandline, with the following args:
```
pico8 -displays_x X -displays_y Y -- X and Y are how wide and tall the displays will be, integers
```
2. Within your cart, you must enable multidisplay with a poke:
```
poke(0x5f36,1) 
```
3. You now have access to four displays! you must switch between them manually, and draw to them separately. This is a major CPU consumer!
```
function _draw()
    for i=0,3,1 do
        _map_display(i)
        clr(i)
        circ(64,64,10,i+2)
    end
end
```
